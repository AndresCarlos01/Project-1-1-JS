        <p class="lead">
          <em><strong>Sports</strong></em> hold a special place in my heart,
          representing some of my deepest passions throughout my life. From my
          earliest memories, sports have been an integral part of my existence,
          shaping my experiences and preferences. During my childhood, my
          primary focus was on two specific sports: soccer and football. Despite
          my interest in both, soccer became the sport I truly grew up playing
          and dedicating my time to. As a result, my love for soccer has become
          a defining aspect of my identity.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hide mb-4">
        <p class="lead">
          Beyond the thrill of competition, sports have taught me valuable life
          lessons such as discipline, resilience, and the importance of setting
          and achieving goals without being afraid to fail. Whether through
          casual games with friends or more formal competitions, sports have
          been a reliable source of joy, stress relief, and personal growth. My
          passion for sports extends beyond playing to include avidly following
          leagues, teams, and athletes, allowing me to stay connected to the
          ever-evolving world of sports. Just to list a few of the teams I
          support for soccer I am a fan of
          <strong>Barcelona (Spain) and Cruz Azul (Mexico)</strong>
          and for football I am a <strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong> fan.

      <h2 class="mt-4">Working Out</h2>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <p class="lead">
          <strong>Working Out</strong> has been something that has become a
          hobby and passion of mine. As I kept growing up I reached a point
          where the demands of time made it challenging to continue playing
          sports, particularly soccer. Faced with the void left by the absence
          of sports, I found myself seeking an alternative to stay active and
          engaged. It was during this period that my best friend introduced me
          to the world of weightlifting and gym workouts. Intrigued by the idea,
          I accepted his invitation to join him one day, and that experience
          marked the beginning of a transformative journey.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hide mb-4">
        <p class="lead">
          The gym became more than a place for physical exercise; it became a
          sanctuary where I discovered a new and fulfilling hobby. The rhythm of
          lifting weights and the discipline of a workout routine not only
          filled the void left by soccer but also ignited a passion for
          maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle. Over time, working out has
          become an essential part of my daily routine, offering not just
          physical benefits but also mental well-being. The camaraderie built in
          the gym, the sense of achievement with each workout, and the
          continuous pursuit of personal fitness goals have collectively turned
          working out into a cornerstone of my identity. It's not just a
          pastime; it's a source of motivation, self-discovery, and enduring
          fulfillment.

      <h2 class="mt-4">Embracing the Gaming Universe</h2>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <p class="lead">
          <strong>Gaming</strong> is a crucial part of the fabric of my life. It
          all began with my first video game console, a GameCube, and while I
          can't precisely recall the name of my first game, I vividly remember
          it being a Mario video game. This initial exposure marked the genesis
          of a passion that would captivate me for years to come. As I explored
          deeper into the realms of gaming, I found myself captivated by the
          diverse and immersive experiences it offered.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="hide mb-4">
        <p class="lead">
          Throughout my life, when sports weren't claiming my attention, I could
          be found engrossed in video games for hours on end, of course with
          certain limitations imposed by my parents. The allure of virtual
          worlds, the challenge of conquering in-game obstacles, and the
          storytelling within video games became an integral part of my spare
          time. Navigating through various gaming platforms and genres, I
          developed a keen appreciation for the evolving landscape of the gaming
          industry. It wasn't merely a pastime; it became a means of
          exploration, relaxation, and a social connector, forging connections
          with friends over shared gaming experiences. Despite the parental
          restrictions, my enthusiasm for gaming persisted, growing alongside
          the industry's innovations, making it an enduring aspect of my
          identity and a cherished source of entertainment and creativity.
